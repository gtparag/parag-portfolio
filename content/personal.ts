    {
      heading: "Curiosity as a Compass",
      content: `I've always been driven by an insatiable curiosity about how things work. As a kid, I took apart electronics just to see what was inside. Today, that same curiosity leads me to explore the frontiers of AI and machine learning, not because it's trendy, but because understanding intelligence, whether artificial or natural, feels like one of the most profound puzzles of our time.`,
    },
    {
      heading: "The Joy of Complex Problems",
      content: `There's a particular kind of satisfaction that comes from wrestling with a problem that seems impossible at first, from feeling completely stuck to that moment when everything clicks into place. That's the feeling I chase. Whether it's optimizing a neural network architecture or designing a system that scales, the challenge is the reward.`,
    },
    {
      heading: "AI as Augmentation",
      content: `I believe AI should amplify human potential, not replace it. The tools I build are designed to help people think bigger, create faster, and solve harder problems. When I work on an ML project, I'm not just building a model, I'm building a partner for human creativity and problem-solving.`,
    },
    {
      heading: "Building What Matters",
      content: `I want to work on technology that moves the needle. Not incremental improvements, but foundational advances that unlock new possibilities. That's why I'm drawn to AI research at organizations pushing the boundaries of what's possible. The opportunity to contribute to systems that could reshape how humanity works, thinks, and creates is what gets me up in the morning.`,
    },
  ],

  closingThought: `Every line of code I write is a bet on the future, a small piece of the bridge between where we are and where we could be.`,
